# Changelog

All notable changes to the **orchestrate** skill are documented here.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) ·
Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org/) — **MAJOR** = invocation grammar or strategy-contract
breaks, **MINOR** = new strategies/dimensions/aliases or new reference material that changes
behavior, **PATCH** = fixes, doc corrections, prompt tuning with unchanged behavior.

The release procedure synchronizes `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, this changelog, git tag
`v<version>`, and the matching GitHub Release. Runtime `SKILL.md` contains no version metadata.

## [1.15.0] — 2026-09-16

### Added
- **Journal v2 — hash-chained, run-scoped, self-checking.** Every line is an envelope (`schema`,
  `run`, monotonic `seq`, `ts`/`ts_utc`, `actor`, `prev`/`hash` sha256 chain); `board check`
  reports an edited, inserted, removed or reordered line; the board header shows integrity
  problems; `board init` archives the previous run's whole workspace to `archive/<run-id>/` so one
  workspace holds one run (`--resume` adds tasks instead); v1 journals and the pre-release
  `board.jsonl` migrate atomically on first read with `.bak` copies; the `run` record carries
  branch + base sha (the header shows the run's branch, not the viewer's worktree).
- **New events and guards.** `board set key=value` re-resolves a dimension (plan back to pending,
  trail kept in `run.md`); `board gate N --kind --verdict` closes a gate explicitly and outranks the
  findings-file parse — which now takes the FIRST verdict mark in text order; every implementer
  dispatch is a new *attempt* that resets the review cycle; `board done` writes the ledger line and
  is refused over a failed gate; `board finish --gate pass` needs `--evidence`, is refused while
  `check --finish` is dirty (unless `--force --reason`), binds HEAD + goal hash + journal cursor and
  is rendered STALE when later work, a moved HEAD or a changed goal invalidates it; `REFUSED`
  joins the status enum for xcli empty-diff declines; `--model` is required on every dispatch.
- **Typed liveness.** Artifact time (deliverable mtimes) is the only liveness clock; notes are
  heartbeats. Stale checks cover every open stint, reviewers included ("reviewer silence").
- **Views.** `board attention` (what to act on, most urgent first, with the next action), `board
  task N`, `--json` on show/agents/check/log, `board resume` with open-stint locators, probed
  pointers, `NOT_PROVEN` marks, cleanup list and a receipt (HEAD · journal cursor · receipt hash).
- **Renderer.** Attention strip in the header; empty columns collapse to one line and done to the
  newest three; `j/k` focus + `enter` opens one card's lineage, `e` expands all, `a` attention-only;
  narrow panes drop model/engine from card meta; red reserved for failures (todo is neutral);
  truecolor / 256 / 16-colour profiles by capability, `NO_COLOR`, `BOARD_ASCII=1`; titles, notes
  and decisions sanitised (C0/C1/ESC/bidi) before they reach the terminal; watch polls top-level
  files only, never the archive.
- **Engine catalog corrected from live probes (2026-09-16).** Codex 0.154: `gpt-6-astra` (client
  ≥0.153), `ultra` effort ("automatic task delegation"), `exec` drops `-a` and gains `--worktree`,
  `resume` takes `-c sandbox_mode` not `--sandbox` and ignores a positional prompt with redirected
  stdin, `--last` is cwd-hijackable — resume by id; agents TOML fields; `web_search=live`. Grok
  1.0.25: `grok-4.6`, `--reasoning-effort`, `--prompt-file`, `-w/--worktree`, `--sandbox`. opencode
  1.18: `--format json`, `--variant`. Hermes 0.18: `--usage-file`, `--worktree`. Claude: `--effort`.
  Hosts matrix: Codex WORKTREE ✅, DISPATCH row names the TOML fields.
- **New reference `shared-lane-hygiene.md`** (directly routed): probe flags per session, wrapper
  launches with explicit redirects, prompts from files, resume by explicit id, quota stall =
  BLOCKED + resume the same session (97% cache hits observed), journal every failed launch,
  capture usage receipts. `strategy-xcli.md` journals `REFUSED`; `shared-contracts.md`,
  `shared-monitoring.md`, `shared-handoff.md`, `shared-review-gates.md`, SKILL.md steps 3/6/8 wired;
  three new replicated-invariant lines; traversal eval `xcli-resume-after-quota`.

### Source
- An independent cross-lineage review by Codex `gpt-5.6-sol @ ultra` with five `gpt-5.6-luna`
  research subagents (web + X), run through this very skill on 2026-09-15/16 — its report and
  digests drove this release; the run's own stalls (quota, three flag mismatches) drove the lane
  hygiene reference.

## [1.14.0] — 2026-09-15

### Added
- **The journal — `.orchestrate/journal.jsonl`, the run's spine.** One append-only line per fact
  the disk cannot show, written by the CONTROLLER at steps it already performs: `board init PLAN
  --strategy … --goal` (the `run` record + every task queued), `board plan approved|changed|
  skipped`, `board dispatch N --agent --model [--role --engine --worktree]`, `board return N
  --agent --status … [--commits --report --observed-model --tokens]`, `board review N --kind
  --round`, `board nudge` / `board escalate --to --why`, `board decide ID "…"` (also appends
  `decisions.md`), `board rail "…"`, `board finish --gate pass|fail`. Workers get one optional
  heartbeat, `board note`. Per the invariants (observation ≠ transition) only the controller
  records transitions; the ledger stays final.
- **`run.md` gains a generated `## Resolved` block** (`<!-- board:resolved -->` markers) —
  goal, dimensions, models with requested→observed drift, budget, plan outcome, rails, kickoff —
  written by `board init` and kept current by `plan`/`return`/`rail`; controller prose below it.
  The flight-plan rule "run.md rendered, never a second source" is now literally true.
- **`scripts/board` — every view is derived from the journal + disk, CLI-agnostic, stdlib-only
  python3 (raw-ANSI truecolor painter, no curses):** `board` live kanban in a pane the USER opens
  (zero-install copy at `.orchestrate/board`, `install.sh` also puts `board` on `~/.local/bin`) —
  header with goal · run · models (drift flagged `!`) · budget used/cap (agents from dispatches,
  cycles from the ledger, tokens from returns) · plan · rails · decisions, then todo / in progress
  (`> agent · model · elapsed`, `! stale` after 10 min without an artifact delta) / review (`spec
  ok r1 · quality fail r1`) / done / blocked, `e` toggles an expanded view with each card's
  lineage (agents · model · window · status · tokens, gates, files, decisions, last note);
  `board plan` renders the flight plan in the format
  contract, deterministic per strategy; `board agents` roster; `board log` timeline; `board
  check` reconciliation (dispatched-never-returned, stale, report-without-review, ledger lines
  naming missing commits/artifacts, skipped tasks, model drift, budget overrun; exit 1); `board
  resume` generates the handoff's state layer in `shared-handoff.md` order.
- `board --selftest` replays a staged run in a temp repo and asserts every derivation; wired into
  `scripts/check-sync` together with two new replicated-invariant lines (`board init`, `board
  return`). Core workflow steps 3/5/6/8, `shared-contracts.md` ("The journal"), `shared-flight-
  plan.md`, `shared-monitoring.md`, `shared-handoff.md`, `shared-model-routing.md` rule 13 and
  `strategy-staged.md` wired; traversal eval `board-watch`; `docs/usage.md` "The journal".

### Deliberately not done
- No `board open`: Ghostty on macOS exposes no split IPC (`+new-window` is Linux/D-Bus only;
  community tools fake keystrokes via Accessibility). The user owns the pane; the skill owns the
  record. A new split inherits the cwd everywhere that matters, and the script resolves the
  workspace through the main worktree.
- No hooks, daemon or TUI framework — the journal is written with bash by the controller, so
  Codex, Grok, opencode and Pi get exactly the same trace.

## [1.13.1] — 2026-09-10

### Site & visual guide
- Start-here install block now shows both install paths — `npx skills add` and the
  clone + `./install.sh <target>` route — matching `README.md` and `docs/installation.md`.
  Target list carries all eleven installer arguments, including `kimi` and `pi`.

## [1.13.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Pi as a supported host** (`./install.sh pi`, new column + rows across `shared-hosts.md`). Pi
  implements the Agent Skills standard — auto-discovery from `~/.pi/agent/skills/` and
  `~/.agents/skills/` (global) plus `.pi/skills/`/`.agents/skills/` (project, trust-gated),
  `/skill:orchestrate` explicit form, description auto-trigger with progressive disclosure. As a
  controller it is the **thinnest host**: no subagents, no structured ask-user, no background
  shell, no native loop — every multi-agent primitive lands on degradation-ladder step 2 (xcli
  processes in worktrees), which also makes every model pin explicit by construction (noted in
  routing rule 12). Detection row (bare `read`/`bash`/`edit`/`write`/`grep`/`find`/`ls` toolset +
  `/skill:` commands), capability-matrix column, ASK_USER binding (free-form interactive only —
  headless cannot ask), state paths (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/`, `/export`), and a quirks entry (no
  sandbox/approvals, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md loaded by default, `defaultProjectTrust`) added.
  Installer target `pi` ships to both discovery paths; README/installation/site host tables and
  `llms.txt` updated. Docs-verified 2026-08-13 (pi.dev/docs/latest), no live probe yet.
- README's xcli strategy row now names the engine list (Codex, Grok, Cursor, agy, opencode,
  Hermes, Kimi, Pi).

## [1.12.0] — 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Pi as a ninth external engine** (`engine=pi`, new Pi block in `shared-engines.md`). Earendil's
  minimal, provider-agnostic coding agent (npm `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`) joins the
  catalog: `pi -p` one-shots with `@file` brief attachment, `--mode json` JSONL events (final
  message in `message_end`) and a `--mode rpc` surface, sessions under `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`
  with `--no-session` for ephemeral fleet lanes. Model AND effort pin on one command line
  (`--model <provider/id>`, `--thinking off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max`) — routing rule 1
  satisfied natively; the effort enum joins rule 8's flag list and rule 9 records Pi as a
  **carrier with no model list of its own** (tier = the pinned provider's model, no extra vote in
  a cross-lineage panel; its value is reaching a model or subscription quota — Claude Pro/Max,
  ChatGPT Plus/Pro, Copilot OAuth — no other lane offers). Containment posture recorded honestly:
  **no sandbox, no approval prompts at all**, headless bypasses even the project-trust gate —
  worktree + diff review is the minimum, a container for untrusted work (the vendor's own
  guidance); loads `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` by default, so the codex AGENTS.md-refusal gotcha
  applies (`-nc` + `--no-extensions` for hermetic lanes). No built-in MCP/subagents/background
  bash — a true leaf worker that won't swarm. Docs-verified against pi.dev/docs/latest
  (2026-08-13, no local install); `pi --help` before scripting, per the standing catalog rule.
- `engine=pi` wired through every enumeration surface: SKILL.md grammar + dimensions table,
  `strategy-xcli.md` preset + division-of-labor, `docs/usage.md` (grammar, argument table,
  dimensions table, `### engine` prose), `docs/strategies.md` (xcli enum, per-engine bullet,
  composition overrides), `docs/installation.md`, site dimensions table + grammar + `llms.txt`.

## [1.11.0] — 2026-08-07

### Added
- **The flight plan — no silent launch** (new `shared-flight-plan.md`, universal rule 9, core
  workflow step 5, `confirm=on|off` dimension). Before the first multi-agent dispatch, the
  controller prints the resolved design — a topology tree (one node per agent that will exist,
  `model @ effort` and isolation on every line, review gates as children, the final-deliverable
  gate last), plus `gates` / `rails` / `budget` footer strips and numbered tweak keys — then
  gates on the user's approval via the host's ASK_USER binding. "change 3 to max" re-resolves
  that dimension, reprints only the changed lines, and re-asks. The plan is `run.md` rendered,
  never a second source; the outcome (approved / changed / skipped and why) is appended to
  `run.md`. `confirm=off` skips the gate, never the print; headless runs print and proceed (a
  gate that cannot render must not hang the run); solo/single-reviewer runs are exempt. The
  budget line is a range from the pack's own multipliers and must name any cap it crosses — the
  flight plan is where cost surprises are supposed to die.

## [1.10.0] — 2026-08-07

Wiring release from a full-pack audit (every runtime file read end-to-end against the v1.9.0
research records and design): v1.9.0 shipped several rules whose applying surfaces never received
them, four research items had fallen through neither adopted nor rejected, and the engine catalog
had outgrown its strategy file. Nothing here adds new doctrine; it makes the existing doctrine
reachable from the places that execute it.

### Added
- **`effort` is now a first-class dimension** (SKILL.md grammar + dimensions table): every prompt
  template header carries an `effort:` field beside `model:`, honestly scoped — where the dispatch
  surface has no per-dispatch effort parameter (the reference host's Agent tool; only workflow
  `agent()` and xcli flags pin per call), the session effort governs and is recorded in `run.md`.
  Routing rule 1 rewritten to say exactly that instead of promising template fields that did not
  exist.
- **`shared-engines.md`** — the per-CLI catalog (codex/grok/claude/cursor/agy/opencode/hermes/
  kimi invocation blocks with verified dates) split out of `strategy-xcli.md`, which keeps the
  rules, lane hardening, staged-codex recipe, and division-of-labor and now sits back under the
  size ceiling. Linked from SKILL.md's shared route; catalog-meaning cross-references re-pointed.
- **Delivery-is-completion for reviewers**: the REVIEWER block (all three byte-identical copies)
  now ends with the delivery clause — the finished-but-silent-reviewer pattern recurred three more
  times in one session, always in roles the clause did not yet cover. Stated block cost updated
  140 → 176 (measured).
- **A verdict binds the brief it judged**: reviewer findings files record the brief's content hash
  (`git hash-object`) beside the judge line; a brief edited after review re-opens the gate
  (`shared-review-gates.md` + both reviewer templates).
- **Spec-as-code**: the priming anatomy names test suites, reference implementations, and rubric
  files as valid spec forms; `prompt-verifier.md` reads a provided rubric file as the criteria
  (vendor guidance item that had fallen through v1.9.0 unrecorded).
- **PR grant beside the PR cap** (`shared-safety-rails.md`): the cap bounds volume; authority is a
  per-child grant issued only after the controller reviewed the actual diff and checks.
- **`run.md` contents enumerated** (`shared-contracts.md`): goal verbatim, dimensions + budget,
  host bindings/degradations, requested AND observed model/effort, single-flight owners, named
  cost postures — the six record obligations v1.9.0 scattered across five files, now listed where
  the file is defined.
- **brief-check mixed-snapshot warning**: multi-brief mode warns when a batch pins more than one
  distinct `@ <sha>` (one-snapshot-per-batch, previously prose-only). Tested: mixed warns, uniform
  is silent, collision detection unchanged.
- **Workflow budget API named** (`strategy-workflow.md`): `budget.total`/`spent()`/`remaining()`
  and the "+500k" directive, with the guard that an unset target makes `remaining()` infinite.
- The "examples constrain" ruling recorded in the priming-anatomy anti-patterns: behavioral
  examples go; parsed output contracts stay.

### Fixed (wiring — rules that had no carrier)
- **Cross-family judge** now reaches its surfaces: staged step 5 and both reviewer template
  headers say it, not only the judge-hygiene section.
- **Failed-rounds tier escalation** wired into the loops that count rounds: staged fix waves cap
  at 2–3 rounds per gate, the review-gates findings loop and the /verify split escalate the tier
  (routing rule 4) before the human — replacing the pre-v1.9 human-only ladder text.
- **The final-deliverable gate is owed explicitly** by every strategy that accumulates changes:
  one-line pointers added to parallel (after integration), hierarchical (after aggregation), team
  (before disband), loop (at goal-met), and workflow (rule 9) — previously only `staged` carried
  it despite the gates file claiming universality.
- **Trajectory-detector cadence stated** (`shared-monitoring.md`): the scan runs at every liveness
  check and before any recovery action — a detector with no cadence never fires.
- Routing rules gain the stable-citation convention (append, never renumber — cited by number from
  five files).
- `config.yaml`: `codex-grind` pins `effort: high` and points at the staged-codex recipe;
  `architect` names Variant C.

### Deliberately not done (recorded)
- No split of `shared-token-economy.md` (2,867 tok, over ceiling): its remaining mass is mandated
  content; a blocks-vs-priming split touches check-sync's block tracking and waits until the file
  grows again. The still-open v1.9.0 watchlist (positive-form block rewrite, computed autonomy +
  shadow mode, provider failover, the full cross-file conflicting-instructions audit) stands.

## [1.9.0] — 2026-08-07

Frontier-hardening release, drawn from a two-part August 2026 sweep: fifteen practitioner sources
read in full, four orchestration repos read from source, and the vendor Opus-5 prompting guide.
Three through-lines — routing decisions are re-decided on observed evidence rather than made once
from the prompt, gates need at least one fact no agent produced, and this pack's own scaffolding is
a cost it has to justify per run. Adopted items carry vendor-authoritative backing, a third-party
measurement, working-code verification, or ≥2 independent practitioner sources; single-source
opinions land as recorded rulings, not rules. Deliberately unchanged: independent spec/quality
review, isolation, honest degradation, the communication blocks' negative-form text, and the
nine-strategy router.

### Added
- **Anchors, judge hygiene, and a final-deliverable gate** (`shared-review-gates.md`; the gate is
  wired into `strategy-staged.md`'s Finish, and the judge pin is carried by
  `prompt-spec-reviewer.md` + `prompt-quality-reviewer.md`, whose findings files now open with the
  reviewing model and round): a gate
  topology made only of agents reading each other's reports can be fully consistent and entirely
  unverified, so every gate names a fact no agent produced (a command that ran, a file on disk at
  a sha, an external readback) and the constraints an optimizer would bend are frozen. Judges are
  cross-family by default, pinned and logged per round, forbidden to score answer shape (length,
  keywords, citation count, phrasing, tool-call count, similarity to a reference), and given
  one-line `Pass iff [independently observable outcome]` rubrics. Before a run reports done, one
  fresh-context review of the accumulated change set against the originally stated goal returns
  ship / fix-first / rethink — with the source's own caveats that same-model review is a
  fresh-eyes check rather than an independent-model one, and that any post-review fix discards
  the verdict.
- **The four invariants** (`shared-contracts.md`): `observation ≠ transition` · `proposal ≠
  authority` · `tool success ≠ accepted progress` · `accepted progress = validation + durable
  writeback + committed readback`. The third closes a real hole — an exit code of 0 only proves
  the process exited.
- **Trajectory-stall detection** (`shared-monitoring.md`): five countable controller-side signals
  (repeated action→observation, repeated error class, ping-pong, rewrite→retest→fail cycles, no
  successful execution for N steps) with progress defined as a successful execution rather than a
  file rewrite; what escalates is counts, classes, digests and evidence paths, never a transcript.
  Thresholds are illustrative defaults from one working-code source, tuned per run.
- **`restart_clean` as a recovery rung** between nudge and respawn (`shared-monitoring.md` rule
  2b), plus **stateful backoff** for external waits (identity, due time, result fingerprint,
  no-change counter, escalating interval; three poll outcomes; an undue monitor never wakes a
  strong model) and a **provisional-handle rule** — never address an agent by a handle returned
  before it exists, and "report back" means the controller performs the wait.
- **Fan-out integrity**: a fan-in guard that counts returns against dispatches and refuses to
  synthesize on a partial set, with layered fan-in on wide runs (`strategy-parallel.md`,
  `strategy-workflow.md`); one revision snapshot per batch, so two workers can't be correct
  against different versions of the truth (`shared-token-economy.md`, `strategy-parallel.md`);
  and replay-safety rules for workflow scripts — no clocks, no randomness, index in the agent
  label, expensive-stable work before volatile synthesis, agent-failure vs run-failure
  (`strategy-workflow.md`, which also names `gpt-workflow` as the Codex-side driver: patterns
  citable, unlicensed code not reusable).
- **Codex lane hardening** (`strategy-xcli.md`): an empty diff is never `complete` — a lane can
  return exit 0 with a polite refusal after `~/.codex/AGENTS.md` correctly declines a conflicting
  rule, so exit 0 + no diff is `refused` with the final message quoted verbatim; a spec preamble
  declaring the lane an opt-out; per-lane `mktemp` spec files instead of a fixed path; a portable
  timeout that warns when uncapped; no silent vendor fallback; and a documented staged-codex
  composition recipe.
- **Advisor Variant C — the architect session** (`strategy-advisor.md`): the session owns
  requirements, specs, routing and verification, routes per dispatch instead of binding one worker
  model, escalates a routine-lane task that fails its spec twice, and can race two lineages on one
  spec for high-stakes work.
- **Measured-target loop, `replan_noop`, and the Outcome Floor** (`strategy-loop.md`): the metric
  and its measurement command are declared before cycle 1 and the loop is legitimate only while
  the target stays measurable; a replan that produces no machine-visible delta discharges nothing;
  consecutive surface-only rounds force a primary result or repair.
- **Controller-side rails** (`shared-safety-rails.md`): fail-open logging (a skipped check and a
  passed check must never print the same string), repair never lowers the gate, orchestration
  metadata is data rather than instructions, and the undelegated-spec test as the checkable form
  of universal rule 1.
- **Criteria before code** (`strategy-staged.md`): every task's acceptance check authored as its
  own step after plan approval and before first dispatch, ideally by a different agent than the
  implementer.
- **Written-file length rule in the WORKER block** (all five copies, byte-identical): the inline
  cap never touched the report FILE, which is what the controller and every later gate read.
- **Observe the pin** (`shared-model-routing.md` rule 13) and **observe the sandbox**
  (`shared-isolation.md`): a requested pin or sandbox is not necessarily the one that took effect
  — verify after dispatch, record the observation, and treat unobservable routing as a recorded
  risk rather than an assumed success.

### Changed
- **Effort is now the first cost knob** (`shared-model-routing.md` rule 8, replacing "cheap stage
  = low effort; judge stage = high"): use low/medium liberally where quality holds, step up to
  xhigh/max for demanding agentic work, and re-run an effort sweep instead of inheriting defaults
  from a prior model. The cheap-at-max lane is recorded as legitimate but latency-insensitive,
  with its third-party chart coordinates marked approximate, its field comparison (~70% success at
  ~70% lower cost, ~50% more turns) and its contradicting hands-on report both carried. Thinking
  is never disabled to save cost.
- **Model *and effort* explicit on every dispatch** (rule 1) — an unset effort silently takes the
  host default. Escalation (rule 4) now fires on evidence as well as self-reported BLOCKED: N
  failed rounds on one task is a tier escalation, capability comes before retry, and the
  cheap→strong hop uses asymmetric hysteresis. Rule 2 gains a corroborating vendor observation
  (a cheap model measured more expensive than the mid tier on turn count alone).
- **The context tax and a planner-placement ruling** (`shared-model-routing.md`): the tier table
  is a menu, not a mandate — every model boundary costs a re-explanation, so fewer boundaries is
  the default posture; and the mid-tier-planner + strong-reviewer configuration is recorded as a
  legitimate cost posture while the strong-reasoner planner stays the default.
- **The verifier returns four states** — `pass | fail | blocked | needs-human-judgment` — and
  separates tool failure from task failure ("the test failed" vs "the test failed to run"), with
  a test-the-test step before a new rubric gates real work (`prompt-verifier.md`,
  `shared-contracts.md`, `shared-review-gates.md`).
- **The implementer no longer re-checks its own work** (`prompt-implementer.md`): the dedicated
  block and job step are replaced by running the brief's verification command and reporting its
  actual output, per vendor guidance that current models verify unprompted and explicit re-check
  instructions add cost without quality. The extrapolation boundary is recorded, and independent
  maker/checker review is untouched. The template also gains the cheaper non-blocking scope move —
  say so in a sentence and continue as asked rather than quietly narrowing or widening the task.
- **Sub-orchestrators justify their spawn count** (`prompt-sub-orchestrator.md`): work finishable
  in a handful of tool calls is not delegated, and one sufficient worker means one worker.
- **The long-context trigger moved** (`triage.md`, `strategy-hierarchical.md`): capacity alone no
  longer routes to `hierarchical`; "graph" is recorded as a routing synonym for parallel/workflow
  and the fake-edge test as the cheap half of partitioning (`triage.md`,
  `strategy-parallel.md`).
- **Honest numbers** (`shared-token-economy.md`): the WORKER block's measured cost restates at
  ≈334 tokens/dispatch after its added sentence, and a >2× harness cost-at-equal-quality finding
  is recorded as an open challenge to this pack's own overhead, not as supporting evidence.
- Public docs synced to the runtime (`docs/strategies.md`, `docs/usage.md`).
- Reference-pack size on disk +5,999 tokens (~21%, `scripts/count-skill-tokens`: 28,163 →
  34,162) — the largest single-release growth so far, and by this release's own G5 rule a cost
  that has to earn its keep. It is a one-time authoring cost, not per-run spend: progressive
  disclosure means a run pays only for the references it opens, and two files
  (`shared-token-economy.md`, `strategy-xcli.md`) now exceed the 2,500-token per-reference review
  threshold as lint warnings.

### Fixed
- **The codex reasoning-effort enum was stale.** It is
  `none|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max` — live-verified against codex 0.144.3 on 2026-08-07 —
  and the previous documentation's extra tier, along with the fan-out behavior attributed to it,
  did not exist (`shared-model-routing.md`, `strategy-xcli.md`, `docs/strategies.md`).
- **A stale cross-reference** in `shared-token-economy.md`'s honest numbers: the
  orchestrate-or-not multipliers cited "rule 7", but the reject-orchestration rule is universal
  rule 8 (pre-existing, surfaced because this release's scaffolding-cost note cites the same rule).

## [1.8.0] — 2026-08-06

Field-hardening release: every entry is a failure observed (most repeatedly) across a 15-skill
family build program run with this pack — the through-line is moving trust from what agents SAY
to what they WROTE. No strategy contracts change.

### Added
- **Delivery-is-completion clause** in the implementer and sub-orchestrator templates: the inline
  report/return is the completion condition; background/teammate roles deliver it via SendMessage
  as their final action. Motivated by the single most common observed worker failure (six
  occurrences): work complete, report parked undelivered (`prompt-implementer.md`,
  `prompt-sub-orchestrator.md`).
- **Disk-first liveness rule** (`shared-monitoring.md` rules 2/3b): check the deliverable's disk
  state before the one nudge; liveness is read from artifact existence + mtime, never process
  count or idle state — both lie in both directions (hung children outlive stopped parents;
  quiet agents write good files).
- **Controller-git rail** (`shared-safety-rails.md`): while any writer is active in a shared
  tree, controller commits are pathspec-scoped — never `git add -A` (observed sweep of a
  concurrent agent's half-written files).
- **Single-flight ownership for shared rate-limited resources** (`shared-safety-rails.md`,
  `strategy-hierarchical.md`): per-IP/per-account-limited services named in `run.md` with one
  owning agent; a documented concurrency cap is a ceiling, not a license (observed 3-worker
  wedge on a 3-proc-cap relay); cleanup kills by process, not by agent.
- **Control-ownership-before-spawn rule** (`strategy-hierarchical.md`): on hosts where lifecycle
  controls sit with the top controller, a flat-roster lead cannot stop its own hung workers —
  grant control, route stops through the controller, or serialize; decide before spawn.
- **Record-outranks-brief precedence** (`shared-contracts.md`, `prompt-implementer.md`): when a
  brief contradicts the binding record (decisions.md, run inventory), workers defer to the
  record and flag it (a double-assigned deliverable was saved exactly this way).
- **Reconcile-from-disk rule** (`shared-contracts.md` ledger): reports are claims, the disk is
  the record — after any fan-out, the ledger reconciles against artifacts on disk, never report
  summaries alone.
- **`write: <path>` exclusive-deliverable pointer** in the priming anatomy
  (`shared-token-economy.md`) + **multi-brief collision mode in `scripts/brief-check`**: two
  briefs claiming the same `write:` path or report path fail before dispatch.

## [1.7.0] — 2026-07-21

Informed by Cursor's agent-swarm write-up (2026) via a 3-model cross-lineage panel review —
corroborates the pack's existing context doctrine, notably its context-efficiency stance, no
causal claims.

### Added
- Swarm-economics routing (`shared-model-routing.md` rule 11): hybrid (strong planner + cheapest
  eligible worker) applies only when a brief clears the eligibility gate (brief-check, narrow
  scope, exact verification, no open design seam) — preferred there, never auto-selected outside
  it; else rule 2's floor holds. Planners judged by induced worker tokens, not their own bill.
- Model prompt-sensitivity note (`shared-model-routing.md` rule 10): wording sensitivity varies by
  model — re-tune dispatch templates per model at a recorded boundary, never mid-run.
- Review-lens decorrelation (input + engine-lineage axes, transcripts demoted to forensics-by-path,
  review-economics note) — `shared-review-gates.md`.
- Decision registry (`decisions.md`, IDs/owners, doc-first reconciliation) + guarded on-demand
  field guide (≤40 lines, entry criteria) — `shared-contracts.md` + `shared-token-economy.md`.
- Thrash-signals note (conflict/rework without gate movement, seam growth incl. megafile) →
  repartition — `shared-monitoring.md`.
- Split-brain rule: cross-cutting decisions ID/owner-recorded before delegation, no two
  cards/subtrees leave one open (`strategy-parallel.md`, `strategy-hierarchical.md`).
- Eligibility-gate eval fixture (`evals/output/cases.json`).

### Changed
- Integrator resolves collisions mechanically first, semantic disagreement bounces to the owning
  worker only when intent is needed (`strategy-parallel.md` step 5).
- `strategy-xcli.md` grok block restamped: CLI 0.2.106 defaults to `grok-4.5` (live-verified
  2026-07-20) + routing rules 8–9.
- Reference-pack size on disk +654 tokens (~2.5%, `scripts/count-skill-tokens`: 26,625 → 27,279) —
  a one-time authoring cost, not per-run spend.

## [1.6.0] — 2026-07-20

### Added
- **Kimi Code CLI support** — the eighth `xcli` engine and eighth Agent Skills host; CLI flag
  surface live-verified against the installed `kimi` 0.28.0 binary (2026-07-20).
  - `references/strategy-xcli.md`: new Kimi engine block (`kimi -p`,
    `--output-format text|stream-json`, model pin `-m k3|kimi-for-coding|kimi-for-coding-highspeed`,
    auto-only permission mode headless, no `--cwd` flag, poisoned-session landmine).
  - `references/shared-hosts.md`: Kimi host detection signature and capability-matrix row
    (`Agent`/`AgentSwarm` dispatch and parallel; native `/goal` state machine + blockable Stop
    hook + Cron tools — the strongest non-Claude loop story; `AskUserQuestion` suppressed
    headless; plain-git worktree; no per-dispatch model pin), quirks-that-bite entry,
    invocation-name entry, `references/shared-monitoring.md`'s Kimi state path, and
    `references/strategy-loop.md`'s native `/goal` loop entry.
  - SKILL.md: `engine=` dimension widened; `references/shared-model-routing.md`: `kimi` tier
    entries (`k3`/`kimi-for-coding`/`kimi-for-coding-highspeed`) + host caveat.
  - Public surfaces synced to the runtime: README's supported-hosts matrix, docs/installation.md's
    install table, docs/usage.md and docs/strategies.md's engine enumerations and per-engine
    mechanics, `install.sh`'s `kimi)` target (`~/.kimi-code/skills` + `~/.agents/skills` — Kimi
    does not read `~/.claude/skills/`), and the site's host chip row + agents table. Division-of-
    labor heuristic notes Kimi (Moonshot lineage, K3) as the fourth vote in cross-lineage panels
    and the pick for 1M-context long-horizon work.

### Site & visual guide
- Hero "runs on" line upgraded from plain wrapped text (dangling `·` separators at narrow widths)
  to a chip row: small-caps RUNS ON label + hairline mono chips per host, Claude Code accented as
  the reference; flex-wrap keeps every width tidy.
- Hero row disambiguation: the host chips lost their border (filled `--code-bg` tokens, same
  language as inline code — data, not buttons) and the section-nav pills gained a `#` anchor
  prefix, so metadata tags and in-page links no longer look like the same component.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-07-17

### Added
- Codex plugin packaging and `agents/openai.yaml` client metadata.
- Activation, traversal, output, and compression-ablation evaluation fixtures.
- A repository-local baseline gate for frontmatter, flat direct routing, reference primacy headers,
  long-reference contents lists, plugin/client metadata, runtime scripts, and eval fixtures.
- Explicit mission, product-lifecycle boundary, artifact contract, completion, and durable handoff
  sections in the runtime router.
- Repository-specific `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` guidance, enforced by the baseline gate.

### Changed
- Flattened all 29 references into one directly routed layer with semantic `strategy-*`, `shared-*`,
  and `prompt-*` filenames; no required reference depends on directory discovery.
- Kept the orchestration-specific byte-identity, honest-number, replicated-invariant, and host-layer
  checks as a second gate after universal skill validation.
- Moved version and repository metadata out of runtime `SKILL.md`.
- Adopted the `orchestrate-skill` repository/package name while preserving `orchestrate` as the
  runtime skill identifier.
- Split Codex installation from the cross-agent `~/.agents/skills` target and made replacement
  transactional.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Multi-CLI (coding-agent-agnostic) support** — the skill now runs on any Agent Skills host,
  with Claude Code as the reference implementation. Design: `docs/designs/v1.4.0-multi-cli-support.md`
  (built on eight sourced research reports covering the agentskills.io standard, skills.sh, and
  each target CLI).
  - New `references/shared-hosts.md` — host detection (from the agent's own toolset), a
    capability matrix across Claude Code / Codex / Cursor / Antigravity / opencode / Grok Build /
    Hermes, bindings for six abstract primitives (dispatch, parallel, message, ask-user,
    worktree, loop), a stated-never-silent degradation ladder (native → xcli shell-out → solo
    with a warning), per-host state paths and quirks.
  - SKILL.md: new "Host" section; `engine` dimension widened to
    `claude|codex|grok|cursor|agy|opencode|hermes|mixed`; frontmatter gains `license: MIT` +
    `metadata` (source/guide URLs) per the open spec.
  - `xcli` strategy: four new engine blocks (Cursor `cursor-agent -p` + the headless-ask-user
    trap and ACP alternative; Antigravity `agy -p` with its under-documented flag caveat;
    `opencode run`; `hermes -z` with per-process model pinning) — xcli is now documented as the
    portability floor for hosts missing native primitives.
  - Triage: host gate in step 0 (unsupported strategy → named degradation).
  - `team`/`workflow`: explicit **Host availability** headers (team = Claude Code or Antigravity;
    workflow = Claude Code only) with degradation paths; `loop`: native variants (Antigravity
    Stop-hook continue + `/schedule`, Grok `/goal`/`/loop`) and the universal external-driver
    form; model-routing rule 10 (hosts where per-dispatch pinning is absent or broken);
    monitoring/isolation/token-economy/evolve generalized (host state paths, plain-git worktrees
    as the canonical form, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md/GEMINI.md conventions).
- `install.sh`: per-host targets (`claude|codex|cursor|antigravity|opencode|grok|hermes|agents|all`);
  `agents` = the cross-agent `~/.agents/skills` standard path. README gains a **Supported agents**
  matrix; docs/installation.md covers every host's paths, quirks, and engine table.
- `scripts/check-sync`: host-layer invariants (hosts.md present, team/workflow availability notes
  present, SKILL.md ≤120 lines, hosts.md ≤200 lines).
- docs/usage.md + docs/strategies.md: `engine` values widened everywhere; four new per-engine
  mechanics bullets in the xcli section; division-of-labor heuristic extended.

### Site & visual guide
- The site now states multi-agent support: hero eyebrow generalized to "An agent skill", a muted
  mono "runs on Claude Code · Codex · Cursor · Antigravity · opencode · Grok Build · Hermes" line
  under the hero terminal, and a "supported agents — who runs what" disclosure in Start here (host
  / native subagents / model pin / worth-knowing table + the team/workflow availability note),
  matching the page's existing panel/table language. llms.txt updated to match.
- Strategy decision strip restructured: six free-wrapping mini-cards became one bordered panel —
  a 2×3 grid of aligned "question → strategy" rows with internal hairlines (single column <720px).
- The five-step run pipe and four-step gate pipe (cramped joined cells + floating ▸ arrows)
  replaced by a numbered vertical stepper (`.steps`, same family as the token timeline): circled
  numbers on a connector rail, icon+name titles, full-width text; gate steps keep amber/green
  marker colors. One layout at every viewport.
- Fixed the `loop` glyph (arrowhead floated off the ring; now sits on the arc) and redrew the
  `advisor` glyph (executor ⇄ boxed advisor with two dashed consult arrows).

## [1.3.1] — 2026-07-14

### Changed
- `xcli` strategy + model routing updated for **grok 4.5** (verified against docs.x.ai
  2026-07-14): API flagship `grok-4.5` — 500k context, built for coding/agentic work, reasoning
  effort `low|medium|high` (high default) — documented as reasoner/advisor/peer tier. Explicitly
  noted the CLI/API split: grok CLI 0.2.101 exposes only `grok-composer-2.5-fast`/`grok-build`
  and rejects `-m grok-4.5`; run `grok models` before pinning.
- grok CLI drift fixed (hit live): `-s` now requires a **UUID** session id, not a name;
  examples updated in xcli.md and docs/strategies.md.

### Site & visual guide
- "The idea" section: the planned V1 **"Life of a task" Remotion animation** shipped as a
  progressive enhancement — a 15s themed loop (light + dark renders from one parameterized
  composition in `remotion/`) showing the problem (one agent's context filling), the split
  (controller writes a brief, a fresh worker takes it), the discard (worker fades, files remain),
  the gates (spec ✓ then quality ✓), and the ledger. Desktop ≥720px only; the static poster
  remains for mobile, `prefers-reduced-motion`, no-JS, and the claude.ai guide artifact.
- Site readability redesign (expert-panel run: codex gpt-5.6-sol high · grok-build · fable 5, two
  rounds + synthesis — plan in the run workspace): the page now teaches before it references.
  New narrative order (hero → "The idea" mental-model poster → run spine → preset-over-dimensions
  override figure → triage decision strip + two-sentence strategy cards → gates → tokens → start);
  first-read prose cut to ~1,100 words with a strict term-introduction order; two-register icon
  system (existing topology glyphs for strategies + 27 inlined lucide icons for concepts/steps/
  rails); grammar, model tiers, and the files tree collapsed into `<details>`; install command
  added; nav cut 11 → 5 question-shaped anchors. Same palette/type/components throughout.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-07-14

### Changed
- Built-in aliases renamed to community-recognizable AI-engineering terms (`config.yaml`, README,
  recipes, site): `fortress` → **`red-team`** (adversarial plan + panel review), `blitz` →
  **`swarm`** (parallel fan-out), `overnight` → **`afk`** (unattended goal loop), `penny-wise` →
  **`architect`** (aider-style strong-model-plans / cheap-model-executes). `codex-grind` unchanged.
  **Breaking for saved invocations of the old names** — aliases are user-editable config, so this
  ships as MINOR this early; re-add old names locally in `config.yaml` if you need them.

### Added
- CI: `scripts/check-sync` now runs on every PR and push to main
  (`.github/workflows/check-sync.yml`) — the release gate is enforced, not remembered.

### Fixed
- Human docs re-synced to the current skill (drift audit): usage.md's workspace table gains the
  v1.1.0/v1.2.0 files (`review-task<N>-<kind>-r<round>.md` findings files, `raw/`, `toolbox.md`);
  strategies.md's codex effort list corrected to `low..ultra` (was the pre-2026-07-13
  `minimal..xhigh`); docs/README.md marks token-optimization research as implemented (v1.1.0),
  lists the v1.1.0/v1.2.0 design docs, and adds check-sync to the release lifecycle.

## [1.2.1] — 2026-07-14

Audit fixes — a full walk of the skill package (post-v1.2.0 sanity check) confirmed the design
holds and surfaced three nits, all addressed here.

### Fixed
- `scripts/brief-check`: the report-path check now scans only the brief's Report section. Since
  v1.2.0 mandates `read: .orchestrate/toolbox.md` in every brief, the old whole-file grep matched
  that pointer first and the check passed vacuously — a brief with no report path went undetected.
- WORKER block: orientation sentence reworded role-agnostic ("Orient before acting — read the
  state your task depends on (for code edits: …)"), so integrator/evolve dispatches are no longer
  told to read neighboring modules their roles don't touch. Byte-identity across token-economy.md
  and all four WORKER templates preserved — no per-role variants introduced.
- Honest numbers re-measured after the rewording: WORKER ≈300, REVIEWER ≈140, MINIMAL ≈19
  (was 285/139/18); the stale "~150 tokens of contract" example in the blocks intro corrected to
  ~300; site + guide block-cost badges updated to match.

### Added
- `scripts/check-sync` (repo root — maintenance tooling, NOT shipped with the skill): mechanizes
  the release-time checks — block byte-identity per the dispatch coverage matrix, stated block
  costs vs measured (words×1.33, ±15), and presence of deliberately-replicated invariants
  (fix-wave rule, escalation ladder, overload rule, HEAD~1 warning, 80%-variance stat,
  reward-hacking ban) in every home. Its registry doubles as the sync map for prose the skill
  intentionally restates across files.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-07-13

Worker orientation licensed and tooled — a fresh subagent is EXPECTED to fill its context
(tree, manifests, conventions, neighboring patterns); v1.1.0's discipline governs how findings
enter chat, never whether the worker may learn the repo. Design:
`docs/designs/v1.2.0-orientation.md`.

### Added
- `scripts/toolbox [--refresh]` — zero-token shell probe of the repo's orientation tooling into
  `.orchestrate/toolbox.md` (structure/outline/search recipes with graceful degradation to
  `git ls-files`/grep, manifests, package manager, conventions files); auto-generated by
  `scripts/workspace`; every worker/reviewer brief points at it.
- "Orientation" section in `token-economy.md`: pointers are entry points not fences; the 5-step
  graded ritual (map → shape → rules → one neighboring pattern → symbols before bodies) with
  task-scaled budgets; per-role grading (reviewers targeted, loop cached, integrator git-state).

### Changed
- WORKER block: +"Orient before editing… reading to understand is work, not waste" (≈285 tok,
  honest numbers updated). REVIEWER block: licenses reading surrounding code to judge the diff
  in context, outline-first (≈139 tok).
- Misreadable phrasings fixed: the "explore the codebase and…" anti-pattern now explicitly
  targets vague BRIEFS, not worker orientation; "burns turns exploring" → "blind-searching".

### Site & visual guide (shipped between v1.1.0 and this release)
- New "Token economy" section — role-scoped block cards with honest per-dispatch costs, and a
  **life-of-a-dispatch timeline** (actor-coded steps with token-effect badges: spent / saved /
  quality-guarded; expandable example brief); disk map and run pipeline updated for
  `brief-check`, `token-economy.md`, findings files, and `.orchestrate/raw/`.
- The "Gates & safety rails" gate strip replaced with the numbered workflow pipeline
  (plan-veto → execute → spec → quality → evidence verify, gate-colored) plus an explicit
  fix→re-review loop strip; old pill-row markup and CSS removed.
- Orientation parity with v1.2.0: block-cost badges updated (≈285 / ≈139), "Orients first"
  clause in the timeline's work step, `toolbox` in the scripts map, `toolbox.md` in the
  workspace map.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-07-13

Token & context optimization across every strategy — cut narration, duplication, raw dumps, and
unstructured returns without degrading the context workers receive. Design (twice reviewed by an
external gpt-5.6-sol advisor): `docs/designs/v1.1.0-token-optimization.md`.

### Added
- `references/shared-token-economy.md` — role-scoped communication blocks (WORKER / REVIEWER /
  MINIMAL + team exemption), the priming anatomy ("prime with pointers, not payloads", pinned
  `read: <path> [@ <sha>]` pointer grammar, brief probe-test), raw-output
  redirect-at-execution convention (`.orchestrate/raw/`), controller diet, cache/session
  hygiene, honest numbers, and a dispatch coverage matrix.
- `scripts/brief-check` — executable brief validator (required sections, pointer resolution,
  unpinned-pointer warning under multiple worktrees, report-path check); wired into the staged,
  parallel, hierarchical, and team strategies.
- SKILL.md universal rule 8: *prime with pointers, work silent, report dense*.
- `docs/designs/v1.1.0-token-optimization.md` — the implementation design (advisor-reviewed,
  "ship with amendments" → all amendments adopted).
- docs: "Token economy" section in `usage.md`; optional input-side tooling note in `recipes.md`.

### Changed
- All 10 dispatch prompt templates embed their role's communication block; the implementer's
  clarify-first rule explicitly outranks pick-and-note.
- Reviewer returns restructured: full findings go to a collision-proof findings FILE
  (`review-task<N>-<kind>-r<round>.md`); inline = verdict + counts + path — inline caps can no
  longer truncate findings. Reviewer read-only scope clarified (repo read-only; `.orchestrate/`
  writable).
- `review-gates.md`: the coverage rule — never instruct a reviewer to self-filter findings;
  filtering is the controller's job (measured recall protection).
- `contracts.md`: inline-cap vs report-file norm, line grammars (search/explore returns,
  structured BLOCKED), workspace map gains `raw/` + findings files.
- `handoff.md`: probe-test before trusting any handoff/compaction summary.
- `advisor.md` strategy: server-side advisor tool (`advisor_20260301`) noted for API pipelines.
- `triage.md`: 4×/15× multiplier grounding on the don't-orchestrate rule.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-07-13

### Changed
- `xcli` strategy + model routing updated for the new Codex model family (verified against the
  official model docs): `gpt-5.6-sol` / `gpt-5.6-terra` / `gpt-5.6-luna` with the new reasoning
  effort ladder `low…ultra` (`ultra` fans out Codex-side subagents — documented as a fan-out
  decision, not an effort bump). Engine tier map added to `shared-model-routing.md`.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- `docs/research/token-optimization.md` — research record on token/context/cost optimization for
  multi-agent orchestration (caveman-style output compression, report-only verbosity contracts,
  context-window economics, proven ecosystem techniques). Research only; no strategy behavior
  changed.
- `CHANGELOG.md` + `version:` frontmatter field — release/versioning machinery for the skill.
- Current version stated in the SKILL.md body so an installed agent can answer "which orchestrate
  version do I have?".

### Changed
- Docs reorganized: research records live in `docs/research/` (status header says which release
  implemented them, if any); implementation designs live in `docs/designs/` named
  `v<version>-<topic>.md` (`RESEARCH.md` → `research/foundations.md`, `DESIGN.md` →
  `designs/v1.0.0-initial-architecture.md`). System documented in `docs/README.md`.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-07-13

### Added
- Initial public release: 9 strategies (staged, parallel, hierarchical, team, workflow, loop,
  advisor, adversarial, xcli) as presets over 8 dimensions, auto-triage, dual review gates,
  file-based handoffs (`.orchestrate/` workspace), model routing, safety rails, saved aliases.
- `skills/orchestrate/` skill tree (SKILL.md router + references + prompts + scripts + config.yaml).
- Docs (`docs/`), visual guide (`site/` → orchestrate-skill.vercel.app), skills.sh-standard
  install (`install.sh`, `npx skills add gabros20/orchestrate-skill`).
